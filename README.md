## Introduction

The "Machine Learning for Disease Prediction" project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of various diseases. By analyzing patient data, the system can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## Features

- **Disease Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of diseases based on input features.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.
- **Customizable Models**: Supports various machine learning algorithms.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides accuracy and other performance metrics.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Keval1306/Machine-Learning-for-Disease-Prediction.git
   cd Machine-Learning-for-Disease-Prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys and other configuration details.

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run Train.py
```

You can interact with the application through the Streamlit web interface.

## Model Training

To train the machine learning model, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the dataset**: Ensure your dataset is in the correct format and contains all necessary features.
2. **Preprocess the data**: Use the provided scripts to clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Train the model**: Execute the training script to train the model on your dataset.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the provided evaluation scripts. The system will output accuracy scores and other relevant metrics to help you assess the model's performance.
