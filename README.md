## Features

- **Disease Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of diseases based on input features.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.
- **Customizable Models**: Supports various machine learning algorithms.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides accuracy and other performance metrics.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Keval1306/Machine-Learning-for-Disease-Prediction.git
   cd Machine-Learning-for-Disease-Prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
